## Task 1: Minimization of DFA

You are given a DFA D which has n states, k transition rules and, a accept states. Your goal is to maintain the functionality of D and reduce n and k.

## Task 2: REGEX to NFA

Write a program to convert a given regular expression into its equivalent NFA.
To run the program use: ./a.out < input file > < output file >
